# Anime SSR App

About This Project

This project is a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) anime web application built using Express.js and EJS. I created this project as my capstone to deepen my understanding of SSR concepts, API integration, and full-stack web development.

The goal was to build a responsive and user-friendly web app that fetches real-time anime data from the Jikan API, including top anime, recommendations, search functionality, and detailed anime information. Through this project, I wanted to challenge myself to:

   1.Implement server-side rendering for better SEO and faster initial page loads.

   2. Handle asynchronous data fetching and caching to optimize performance.

   3. Practice clean code organization and error handling.

   4. Explore responsive design to ensure great user experience on various devices.

This project marks an important milestone in my journey as a developer, showcasing both my technical skills and passion for anime.
